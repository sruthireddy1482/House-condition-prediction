Employed two classification techniques, logistic regression and random forest classifier using R in order to predict house condition if it is good, average or poor.Based on the above classification techniques used, The sensitivity metric for logistic regression and random forest classifier is compared and it is observed that random forest classifier predicted the Good and Average classes more accurately when compared to logistic regression. While both the modelsâ€™ predictions for the class Poor is better in the logistic regression model.
